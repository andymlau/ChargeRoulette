# ChargeRoulette: Automating pdb2gmx for gas phase MD simulations

These scripts can be used to automate the charge assigning step of GROMACS pdb2gmx for gas phase molecular dynamics simulations. Gas phase simulations of charged protein complexes are typically performed for comparisons with experimental structural mass spectrometry measurements.  

Assigning charges using the pdb2gmx interactive tool (via -lys -arg -his etc. flags) is very tedious, as the user the prompted to key in a number, e.g. '0' for a non-protonated (-1) aspartic acid, or '1' to have it protonated (0), for every residue in the input file. Hence the motivation for this repo is to put together scripts that can automatically assign such protonation states without needing any input from the user.

A few assumptions are made in terms of how charges are initialised:
1. Mass spec typically produces net positively charged ions, and so to produce such representations, all acidic residues are set to neutral (i.e. protonated) and a number of charges are spread randomly across only the basic residues (lys, arg and his). Termini are also left neutral. 
2. Charge-carrying residues are selected randomly from a set of candidate residues that meet the selection criteria, defined as all lys, arg and his residues within 5Ã… depth of the surface of the molecule. 
3. ChargeRoulette does not clean your file for you - it is assumed that your pdb file is set up properly, i.e. chain and residue ids are correct and that any chain breaks in the molecule are intended or at least acknowledged. For general pdb file manipulation, [pdb-tools](http://www.bonvinlab.org/pdb-tools/) from the Bonvin Lab is recommended.

### Prerequisites:

- [GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/) (tested on version 2021.3 released August 18th, 2021)
- The 'expect' program for linux: https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect
- At least Python 3.

### Instructions for use:

The following files are distributed:
- **run_charge_roulette.sh** - This is the main chargeroulette script that should be run.
- **residuetypes.dat** - A custom residuetypes.dat file that includes 'LYSN' to allow lysines to be charged. 
- **README.md** - This readme file.
- **scripts/charge_roulette.py** - Handles input pdb parsing and charge sampling. 
- **scripts/utils.py** - Functions for charge_roulette.py
- **examples** - Example input and output files. 

#### Inputs:
1. Given an input pdb file, such as `examples/input/2GRN.pdb`, the file must first be submitted to the DEPTH server found [here](http://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/depth).
2. A zip file containing outputs can be downloaded from the server once the job has been completed. The output file with the suffix `-residue_depth.pdb` should be used for ChargeRoulette. An example output file is supplied at `examples/input/2GRN.pdb-residue_depth.pdb`.

3. The command for running charge roulette is:

```
bash run_charge_roulette.sh input.pdb n_charges n_samples output_directory 
```
e.g. 
```
bash run_charge_roulette.sh examples/inputs/2GRN.pdb-residue_depth.pdb 10 3 examples/test
```

- **input.pdb** (path) is the output file of DEPTH, e.g. `2GRN.pdb-residue_depth.pdb`
- **n_charges** (int) is the number of charges that will be assigned to the surface of the molecule. This should match the experimental charge state of the protein observed via native mass spectrometry. 
- **n_samples** (int) is the number of charge samples, e.g. 10 will produce 10 alternative charge configurations of your input molecule. 
- **output_directory** (path) is the path that the output files should be saved to. 

For example, running ChargeRoulette with n_charges=10, and n_samples=5, will randomly distribute 10 charges on the surface of input.pdb, 5 times.

#### Outputs:
4. A number of output files are written to the user-defined output folder:

- **2GRN.pdb-residue_depth_samples.pdb** - a multi-state pdb file where each state contains the charge-carrying residues. This file is for visualisation only. It can be quite useful to open together this file and the original input pdb, in PyMOL to visualise where the charges have been assigned to. This strategy can be used iteratively to test different distributions of charges and test how they affect the simulation, for example. 
- **2GRN.pdb-residue_depth_samples.txt** - a summary of the residues that were selected in each sample. `1,{14 18 30 49 59 74 101 146},{141},{20}` is in the format: `sample_no, LYS residue numbers, ARG residue numbers, HIS residue numbers'. 
- **sample_x** - subfolders containing the pdb2gmx output files for each set of charges. Running ChargeRoulette with n_samples=10 will generate 10 subfolders. 

Within `sample_x` subfolders:
- ***auto_assign.exp*** - an expect script generated by ChargeRoulette used to interact with pdb2gmx.
- ***run_pdb2gmx.sh*** - a bash script containing the pdb2gmx command.
- **pdb2gmx.log** - a log file containing the stdout of pdb2gmx. 
- **out.pdb** - a pdb2gmx output file. 
- **topol.top** - a pdb2gmx output file. 
- **posre.itp** - a pdb2gmx output file. 

(Files in italics above can be deleted once the program has finished.)

#### Example output:

```
Running charge_roulette.py
  - Will sample 5 charges from 2GRN.pdb-residue_depth.pdb 3 times.
  - The following charges will be assigned: (sample_no,LYS,ARG,HIS):
    1,{18 65 74 101 154},{},{}
    2,{30 49 154},{149},{20}
    3,{101 154},{104 147 149},{}

  Charge set 1:
  - Files in directory: /home/andy/Github/gasMD/examples/outputs/sample_1
  - Total charge 5.000 e

  Charge set 2:
  - Files in directory: /home/andy/Github/gasMD/examples/outputs/sample_2
  - Total charge 5.000 e

  Charge set 3:
  - Files in directory: /home/andy/Github/gasMD/examples/outputs/sample_3
  - Total charge 5.000 e
```

- The 'Total charge' above should be checked in each instance to make sure that the total molecule charge is correct. 

### Other useful customisations:

#### Changing the pdb2gmx run command
By default the pdb2gmx run command is:
```
gmx pdb2gmx -f ${input} -o ${jobdir}/out.pdb -p ${jobdir}/topol.top -i ${jobdir}/posre.itp -v -heavyh -ff oplsaa -water none -lys -arg -asp -glu -his -ter -renum -merge all
```
The flags after -i can be customised by editing the `fflags` variable on line 23 of `run_charge_roulette.sh`.
